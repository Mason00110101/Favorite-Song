        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          [Verse 1] She wondered if those cigarettes were worth the time She
          wished she had the man that she adored right by her side Years went by
          like shootin' stars, you think you'll live forever Burnin' time just
          like cigarettes, losing breath and feelin' weathered And feelin'
          weathered
        </p>
        <p>
          [Verse 2] Sometimes he drank and smoked just to cover up the pain Saw
          things as a boy that a boy should nevеr see This world was like a
          powder keg, his lifе was like a dream But when life was too much, he'd
          say, "At least you still have me"
        </p>
        <p>
          [Chorus] Those cowboy killers weren't worth the time Those cowboy
          killers weren't worth the time Cowboy killers weren't worth the time
          Those cowboy killers weren't worth the time Cowboy killers weren't
          worth the time Those cowboy killers weren't worth the time
        </p>
        <p>
          [Verse 3] Smokin' cigarettes, drinkin' coffee on the porch Left behind
          his grandkids and the girl that he adored His life was full of
          splendor but he cut it way too short Died at sixty-five, smokin'
          cigarettes out on the porch
        </p>
        <p>
          [Chorus] Those cowboy killers weren't worth the time Those cowboy
          killers weren't worth the time Cowboy killers weren't worth the time
          Those cowboy killers weren't worth the time
        </p>
        <p>
          [Bridge] She wished she had him back as she speaks with teary eyes
          Tellin' me to quit those cigarettes, my girl wants me by her side My
          girl wants me by her side
        </p>
        <p>
          [Chorus] Those cowboy killers weren't worth the time Those cowboy
          killers weren't worth the time Cowboy killers weren't worth the time
          Those cowboy killers weren't worth the time
        </p>
